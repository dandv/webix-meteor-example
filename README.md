Example of Webix-Meteor integration
===================================

This example uses native Meteor features and is a recommended way when you need to add only some Webix controls to the existing Meteor app.

### Currently implemented

- data syncing between Meteor collections and Webix data components
- using Meteor templates inside of Webix UI
- using Webix UI inside of Meteor templates
- using native Meteor routing with Webix UI



Alternative example 
--------------------

If you plan to use a lot of Webix components and Webix layout for UI organization then check the alternative example.
